    <section class="section1" id="about">
        <p>After six years as a CIPD Level 3 qualified HR professional - with a focus on people, EDI, and wellbeing - I’ve made the decision to pivot into tech and pursue a long-standing interest in software engineering.<br><br>

            My journey into tech isn’t entirely new. With an academic background in science and a lifelong interest in computers, design, and data, I’ve always found myself drawn to problem-solving through technology. Even in HR, I gravitated toward systems - becoming the go-to superuser, automating workflows, and building tools that made teams more efficient. Over time, I realised what I enjoyed most wasn’t just optimising processes—it was the creativity and logic of building things from the ground up.<br><br>
            
            In late 2024, I made the leap: I left my HR Manager role to fully commit to learning to code. Since then, I’ve been immersed in e-learning, webinars, and now a full-time coding bootcamp, with a focus on full-stack development.<br><br>
            
            My experience in HR gives me a unique edge. I understand the importance of communication, collaboration, and leadership - skills that are just as critical in tech. I’ve also seen firsthand the gap between strong technical talent and people-first thinking, and I believe I can bridge that divide.<br><br>
            
            I’m particularly excited by the potential of tech to create meaningful, inclusive change. As someone with ADHD, I know the value of tools that empower people - and I’m driven to build products that do just that.<br><br>
            
            Curious, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning, I’m now looking ahead to opportunities where I can grow as a developer, contribute to mission-driven teams, and continue evolving in this exciting new field.
